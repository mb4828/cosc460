Report for Lab 3
----------------

Answer the questions from the lab description here.  Questions 8 and 9 do not require answers.

1. Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, Operator, OrderBy, Project, SeqScan, TupleIterator
2. Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, OrderBy, Project
3. Select (filter), project (project), join (join)
4. Next and hasNext are implemented in simpleDb.operator. Filter extends the operator class and uses its code, hence why it is a subclass.
5.	
	while iterR.hasNext():
		tuple t = iterR.next()
		if t matches predicate:
			return t
	return null

6.
	list = []
	iterR.rewind()

	while iterR.hasNext():
		iterS.rewind()
		tuple t1 = iterR.next()

		while iterS.hasNext():
			tuple t2 = iterS.next()
			if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
				tNew = merge(t1,t2)
				list.append(tNew)
	
7.
	if t1 == null and t1.hasNext():
		t1 = iterR.next()

	while t1 != null:
		while iterS.hasNext():
			t2 = iterS.next()
			if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
				tNew = merge(t1, t2)
				return tNew
		
		if !iterR.hasNext()
			break

		t1 = iterR.next()
		iterS.rewind()

	return null

After you complete lab 3, please answer the following questions.  

1. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

Matt Brauner

2. What did you think of this assignment?

It wasn't extremely difficult but it was long!

3. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

Figuring out the right algorithms for the operators and writing the SQL queries.

4. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

My code does not pass systemtest.DeleteTest. I don't know why and I don't have time to do any further debugging right now due to midterms and projects this week.

5. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

6-7 hours ish? (including lab time)
