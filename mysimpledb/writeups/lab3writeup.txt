Report for Lab 3
----------------

Answer the questions from the lab description here.  Questions 8 and 9 do not require answers.

1. Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, Operator, OrderBy, Project, SeqScan, TupleIterator
2. Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, OrderBy, Project
3. Select (filter), project (project), join (join)
4. Next and hasNext are implemented in simpleDb.operator. Filter extends the operator class and uses its code, hence why it is a subclass.
5.	
	while iterR.hasNext():
		tuple t = iterR.next()
		if t matches predicate:
			return t
	return null

6.
	list = []
	iterR.rewind()

	while iterR.hasNext():
		iterS.rewind()
		tuple t1 = iterR.next()

		while iterS.hasNext():
			tuple t2 = iterS.next()
			if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
				tNew = merge(t1,t2)
				list.append(tNew)
	
7.
	if t1 == null and t1.hasNext():
		t1 = iterR.next()

	while t1 != null:
		while iterS.hasNext():
			t2 = iterS.next()
			if t1 and t2 match join predicate:
				tNew = merge(t1, t2)
				return tNew
		
		if !iterR.hasNext()
			break

		t1 = iterR.next()
		iterS.rewind()

	return null
