Report for Lab 6
----------------

Exercise 1.

1. Briefly explain how logging is done in SimpleDB by describing when log records are written to the log.  Use Eclipse search tools to find all uses of the LogFile methods in the SimpleDB source code.

    When the database is initialized, a new LogFile object is created. Each transaction generates a log entry upon committing. 
    The log is forced whenever we complete a transaction or flush a page from memory. Additionally, I can't find
    any circumstances where abort, CLR, etc. are called. Clearly, this is a very simple implementation of logging that we will
    fix up later.

2. Where is LogFile.force called?  You should include usages inside other LogFile methods.  For each usage, why is it important that force is called?

    Force is called when BufferPool.flushPage is called as well as logAbort, logCheckpoint, and logCommit. It is crucial
    to force the log at these points to ensure that the log is written out to disk and the database will be recoverable
    if the system crashes.

3. Where is setBeforeImage image called?  

    setBeforeImage is called in the initializer for HeapPage to set an initial image when the page is created as well as
    in BufferPool.transactionComplete to update the image after completing the transaction and flushing the page to disk.


Exercise 4.

In answering the next few questions, oncy include method calls in the source code; method calls in the test code can be ignored.

4. Where is BufferPool.flushPage called?

6. Where is BufferPool.flushAllPages called?

7. To support a NO FORCE, STEAL policy, describe exactly when/where pages should be flushed to disk.

After you complete the lab, please answer the following questions.  

8. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

    Matt Brauner

9. What did you think of this assignment?

    It was really interesting figuring out how to make this work. I enjoyed it.

10. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

    Figuring out the proper algorithm for rollback() and recover(). My recover() algorithm wasn't quite right which caused me endless frustration. Luckily, it's pretty well documented in the book.

11. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

    Only the optional problems.

12. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

    7 hrs?
